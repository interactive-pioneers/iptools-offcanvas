# Contributing

## Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!

### Code style
See [JavaScript coding conventions](http://conventions.interactive-pioneers.com/JavaScript) of Interactive Pioneers.

## Bug reports, suggestions

- File all your issues, feature requests [here](https://github.com/interactive-pioneers/iptools-offcanvas/issues)
- If filing a bug report, follow the convention of _Steps to reproduce_ / _What happens?_ / _What should happen?_
- __If you're a developer, write a failing test instead of a bug report__ and send a Pull Request

- `grunt qa` run QA task that includes tests and JSHint
- `grunt build` minify source to dist/
